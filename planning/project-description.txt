Option 5: PasswordKeepR
A storage system for passwords for organzations. An organization, like Lighthouse labs, has many different accounts which need to be shared between users. This app will let an authorized user acess all the passwords of the organization. The app will also let a user generate a new password for a specific account (just like LastPass).
